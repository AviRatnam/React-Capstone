# Capstone Project

This is our Capstone Project under the guidance of PES University in the academic year of 2021.
The contributors are Avinash Ratnam, Rithik Mali, Vibha Kurpad and Harichandana Magapu.

The app is built with the intention of being able to test and pin-point the concepts a student is strong and weak in.
Randomly generated questions, along with unique distractors based on several factors (such as an antonym, word type, meaning) paired along side an accurate explanation for the same using Cosine- Vector Similarity, help a student better understand their problem.
